    "\n",
    "This script demonstrates how LangChain represents data using the `Document` class\n",
    "and why **metadata** is important in RAG and retrieval systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✔️ What this script does\n",
    "\n",
    "- Imports LangChain text utilities & `Document`\n",
    "- Creates a sample `Document` containing:\n",
    "  - `page_content` → the actual text\n",
    "  - `metadata` → contextual information about the text\n",
    "- Prints both content and metadata to show the structure\n",
    "- Explains why metadata is useful\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ Used uv in place of pip\n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses uv instead of pip because it is faster and automatically manages virtual environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "✔️ Commands Used\n",
    "- Initialize the project:\n",
    "- uv init\n",
    "- Install dependencies from requirements.txt:\n",
    "- uv add -r requirements.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "Add an additional package:\n",
    "- uv add pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the script using uv:\n",
    "- uv run python script.py\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Why uv?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Faster than pip\n",
    "- Creates and manages virtual environments automatically\n",
    "- Keeps dependencies isolated and reproducible\n",
    "- Well-suited for modern Python + RAG projects\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🗂️ What is a `Document`?\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Document` in LangChain stores:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Text** (`page_content`)\n",
    "- **Metadata** (`metadata = {...}`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example metadata fields:\n",

    "- page number  \n",
    "- author  \n",
    "- timestamps  \n",

    "- 🔍 Search & filtering\n",
    "- 🧠 Context-aware retrieval\n",
    "- 📚 Grouping and organization\n",
    "- 🧾 Auditing and traceability\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✂️ Why we imported text splitters?\n",
    "\n",
    "The splitters are used later to:\n",
    "1. Break large documents into smaller chunks\n",
    "2. Feed chunks into embeddings / vector DBs\n",
    "3. Build RAG pipelines efficiently\n",
